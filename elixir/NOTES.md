# Elixir

- Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.

## Basic types

- Elixir has 5 basic types: `integers, floats, booleans, atoms, and strings`.
- In Elixir, the operator `/` always returns a float.
- If you want to do integer division or get the division remainder, you can invoke the `div` and `rem` functions.
- You can invoke the `round` function to get the closest integer to a given float.
- You can invoke the `trunc` function to get the integer part of a float.
- The `is_integer` funcition can be used to check if a value is an integer or not.
- Functions in Elixir are identified by both their name and their arity.
- Elixir supports true and false as booleans.
- Elixir also provides three boolean operators: `or/2`, `and/2`, and `not/1`.
- Elixir also provides the concept of `nil` to indicate the absence of a value.
- An atom is a constant whose value is its own name.
- Elixir allows you to skip the leading `:` for the atoms `false`, `true` and `nil`.
- Strings in Elixir are delimited by double quotes, and they are encoded in UTF-8.
- You can concatenate two strings with the `<>/2` operator.
- Elixir also supports string interpolation with `"#{variable}"`.
- You can print a string using the `IO.puts/1` function from the IO module.
- Strings in Elixir are represented internally by contiguous sequences of bytes known as binaries.
- You can get the actual length of the string using the `String.length/1` function.
- Elixir also provides `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, `<` and `>` as comparison operators.

## Lists and tuples
