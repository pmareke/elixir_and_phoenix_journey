# [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)

## Up and Running

- Run `mix phx.new` from any directory in order to bootstrap our Phoenix application.
- Run `mix phx.server` to start the Phoenix server.
- By default, Phoenix accepts requests on port 4000.
- To stop it, we hit `ctrl-c` twice.

## Packages Glossary

- The main packages are:
    - `Ecto`: a language integrated query and database wrapper
    - `Phoenix`: the Phoenix web framework (these docs)
    - `Phoenix LiveView`: build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML. The LiveView project also defines Phoenix.Component and the HEEx template engine, used for rendering HTML content in both regular and real-time applications
